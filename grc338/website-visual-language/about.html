               <p class="body">We're a small travel outfit built by people who believe the best stories come from saying yes to adventure. Our trips aren't luxury tours or rigid itineraries — they're real experiences shaped by good company, early-morning starts, wrong turns that become highlights, and those moments you only get when you're out there moving through a place instead of staring at it.</p>
               <p class="body">From night runs through Tokyo, steep climbs up Mount Fuji, and spiderweb-filled miles on the Kumano Kodo, to icy plunges in Big Sur, cliff jumping in Hydra, and lazy beach days on the Aegean — we design each trip to feel like you're exploring with a group of friends who actually know what they're doing.</p>
               <p class="body">We keep things simple: go outside, try something new, laugh when things get weird, and make memories that stick with you long after you’re home. If you’re up for a little sweat, a little spontaneity, and a lot of fun, you’ll fit right in.</p>
